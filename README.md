# Sensor-Fault-Detection

Problem Statement:
The Air Pressure System (ApS) is a critical component of a heavy-duty vehicle that uses compressed air to force a 
piston to provide pressure to the brake pads, slowing the vehicle down. The benifits of using an APS instead of a 
hydraulic system are the easy availability and long-term sustainability of nature air.

This is Binary classification problem, in which the affirmative class indicates that the failure was caused by a
certain component of the APS, while the negative class indicates that the failure wsa caused by a something else.

Solution Proposed:
In this project, the system in focus is the Air System Pressure(APS) which genertae pressurized air that are 
utilized in various function in a truck, such as braking and gear changes. The dataset positive class corresponds 
to component failures for a specific component of the APS System. The negative class corresponds to trucks with failures
for components not related to the APS system.

The problem is to reduce to cost due to unnecessary repairs. So it is required to minimize the false predictions
